# Indoor Air Quality Forecasting using Deep Learning Neural Networks

## Abstract

This research focuses on exploring forecasting Indoor Air Quality Index (IAQI) trained using data of a sensor fed into a Deep Learning Neural Network. We believe this research is relevant as the air quality may have effects on a large portion of the world population due to the fact that a lot of people stay at indoor spaces for long periods, such as offices, commercial buildings, government offices, schools and homes, specially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Air quality, and particularly Organic Volatile Compounds, have demonstrated an impact on wellbeing and may have health implications.
